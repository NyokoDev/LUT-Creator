# LUT Creator

LUT Creator allows you to create color corrections within Cities: Skylines.

As of February 25, 2024, this project is currently in the development stage. The project has been discarded, remade several times but I hope this will be the last one for a fully stable mod. Note the current build on the Workshop will be replaced with this build.

# Installation

There's already a LUT Creator page in Workshop, however it requires Lumina to function. In the future, this requirement will be dropped entirely.
